# Programming Session 1-2

This repository contains my first Python script created during Programming Session 1-2.

## File Included
- `Session1-2.py`

## Description
The script demonstrates basic Python concepts such as:
- Printing text and numbers
- Using quotations to display text in `print()`
- Using quotations inside quotations to print text with quotation marks
- Arithmetic operations
- Using `\n` to create new lines and add spacing in the output
- Use of `sep` and `end` parameters in `print()`

This project was created as part of my coursework in class to practice Python fundamentals and using GitHub.
